Overall, our analysis of Global Shala’s Super Hero U Facebook ad campaigns highlights both strong performers and areas for improvement. Campaigns 2 and 6 emerged as the most effective, delivering high engagement at a low cost, with Campaign 2 achieving an impressive CTR of 17.79% and CPR of just $3.10. Campaign 7 also showed balanced performance with moderate cost efficiency. On the other hand, campaigns like 3, 10, and 11 struggled due to high CPR and CPC, indicating inefficient spending with limited reach. A key takeaway is that targeting the 25–34 age group proved most effective, while older demographics (55–64) saw high ad spend with low engagement, showing a need for budget reallocation. To maximize performance, scaling successful campaigns and optimizing underperformers through refined targeting and content strategies will be crucial. Based on these findings, we recommend discontinuing campaigns 3, 10, and 11, as their high costs and low reach make them inefficient. Redirecting resources toward high-performing campaigns and improving audience targeting will enhance overall campaign efficiency.
So that's all about your analysis
